# Build Kararead and install it on a connected Android device, then launch it.

# Handy when working from IntelliJ IDEA (which lacks Android Studio's Run
# button): connect your phone with USB debugging enabled (or pair over Wi-Fi
# with `adb connect <ip>:<port>`) and run this from the IDE terminal.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/install.sh             build + install + launch the debug build
#   ./scripts/install.sh --release   build + install the (debug-signed) release build
#   ./scripts/install.sh --no-launch  skip launching the app after install
#   ./scripts/install.sh --help       show this help
#
